# Logistics Operations Data Warehouse & Data Analysis Project

## About Dataset
As described in *[1]*, this dataset is a complete operational database from a fictional Class 8 trucking company spanning three years (2022-2024). This isn't scraped web data or simplified tutorial content—it's a realistic simulation built from 12 years of real-world logistics experience, designed specifically for analysts transitioning into supply chain and transportation domains.

The dataset contains 85,000+ records across 14 interconnected tables covering everything from driver assignments and fuel purchases to maintenance schedules and delivery performance. Each table maintains proper foreign key relationships, making this ideal for practicing complex SQL queries, building data pipelines, or developing operational dashboards.

Most logistics datasets are either proprietary (unavailable) or overly simplified (unrealistic). This fills the gap: operational complexity without confidentiality concerns.

More details about the dataset can be found in the original source *[1]*.
